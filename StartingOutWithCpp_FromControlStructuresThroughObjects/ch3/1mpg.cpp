/*
Miles per Gallon
Write a program that calculates a carâ€™s gas mileage. The program should ask the user
to enter the number of gallons of gas the car can hold and the number of miles it can
be driven on a full tank. It should then display the number of miles that may be driven
per gallon of gas.
