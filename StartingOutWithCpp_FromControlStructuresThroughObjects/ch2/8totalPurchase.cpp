/*
Total  Purchase  
A customer in a store is purchasing five items. 
The prices of the five items are 
    Price of item 1 = $15.95 
    Price of item 2 = $24.95 
    Price of item 3 = $6.95 
    Price of item 4 = $12.95 
    Price of item 5 = $3.95 

Write a program that holds the prices of the five items in five variables. 
Display each itemâ€™s price, the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total. 
Assume the sales tax is 7%
