/*
Cyborg Data Type Sizes 
You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg supercomputer. 
In order to accomplish some calculations, 
  you need to know how many bytes the following data types use: 
    char, 
    int, 
    float, 
    and double. 
  You do not have any manuals, so you canâ€™t look this information up. 
  
Write a C++ program that will determine the amount of memory used by these types and display the information on the screen.
